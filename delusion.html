            <i>Pious Obiri is my name,a student of the university of ghana.</i>
           Talking more about myself, I am a young man with the mindset of a business man and this write-up seeks to motivate anyone out<br> there with similar amdbitions.
           Education in itself comes in two forms. Formal education which has to do with acquiring knowledge. <br> School they say is the journey to successs.  
           Misunderstanding this concept is what makes the ghanaian child <br>  inferior to the white man.
           young ones coming up, i do not know what you have <br>  been told but its does not take one to get into his 40s to make money, i believe if you have a vision and start early with your strength <br>  in the lord, as early as 25 you can be a millionaire
           not to put a hault to formal education but, too much school does not get everyone to their destination. <br>  gifted vocational students, do not waste your time in school for degrees and certificates which would not play any great role in making <br>  a name for yourself.
           i would say school is for some selected people, but through the walks of life, <br>  if you are determined to do something then commit yourself to it and give it the best
            As a business minded person with the visions of becoming a trillionaire at the age of 30, with the little amount in my coffers invested everything <br>  i had into a mlti million doollar project initiated by the big six of the country. 
            The earnings of this investment is what i used to cover grounds by acquiring a vars land size to commence operations on raising my building of "DECK's Co", which entails enterprises of different services  <br> and goods production.
            Below are some of the buildings under my name.

            Owning quiet a lot to call myself a rich man, I make it a point to help out the poor and needy. This is done in my own way which begins by signing  <br> an agreement and doing everything possible to earn my trust as your employer. In otherwords I push my employees beyond their limit to make sure my work is done and suited to my taste, that of course does not imply <br>  I am a wicked man of any sort. It is a stratergy to sort out potential long term employees from the lot.
            Long story put short, although i do not support the ideas of futher  <br> schooling getting you anywhere, i do believe that with hardwork and determination and your stable mind anything is possible.
